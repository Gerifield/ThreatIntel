# CUJO AI Labs - Threat Intelligence Repository  

This is a Threat Intelligence (TI) repository to store published indicators of compromise, threat detection rules and scripts from CUJO AI Labs reports.  

## :mag_right: Threat detection rules  

The rules published here have been tested and it was made sure that they do not raise false positives, but they may need additional tuning if applied in your own environment. Keep that in mind!  

## :space_invader: Indicator of compromise digests  

We will house indicators of compromise (IoCs) digests here from our blogposts.

## :pencil: Scripts related to malware

We may release certain decoding/decrypting scripts that will ease the analysis of the given malware families.
