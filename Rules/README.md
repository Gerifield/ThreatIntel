# CUJO AI Labs - Threat Intelligence Repository  

This is a Threat Intelligence (TI) repository to store published indicators of compromise, threat detection rules and scripts from CUJO AI Labs reports.  

## :mag_right: Threat detection rules  

The rules published here have been tested and it was made sure that they do not raise false positives, but they may need additional tuning if applied in your own environment. Keep that in mind!
